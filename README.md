## Customization Guide

The various sections in the HTML and CSS are well commented, so feel free to change whatever doesn't suit you need.

The JavaScript functions are commented too, so you will know what the functions and selections do.


For the form submission, formspree was used. You can get a hands-on tutorial on how to use formspree by google searching it

In addition to formspree, you can also use Netlify form submission in case you deploy there.
